==========================
What's new in this release
==========================

3.1
---

Improvements

    * Improved information hiding when a user has access to a folder or
      document but not to at least some of its parent folders.
    * Simplified permissions management page.
    * Handle large numbers of groups better.
    * Can now handle international characters in a number of character
      sets for searching.
    * Ideographic languages can now set "useLike = true" in the i18n
      section of the config.ini file to use a (slower) search that will
      return results.

New Features

    * New "Core: Folder Details" permissions allows more granular
      permission assignment, allowing folder visibility (including in
      breadcrumbs) to be controlled.
    * The ability to make documents immutable, whereupon no new versions
      are possible, and only unit or system administrators can move or
      delete them, or edit their metadata.
    * "Request Assistance" document action, which allows users to request
      changes to documents that they don't have the permissions to 
    * Workflow triggers, which allow actions to be performed at certain
      stages in the workflow life-cycle.
    * Columns to be displayed for browse and search can be configured by
      an administrator.


3.0.3
-----

Improvements

    * KnowledgeTree can now be upgraded from the previous "packaged" install,
      using the automated upgrade installer.  If you have already installed
      KnowledgeTree using our Bitrock installer, please use the "upgrade"
      installer.
    * Permission-related messages during workflow are now more user-friendly.
    * Help files can now be translated into different languages.
    * Workflow editing has been made more intuitive.
    * The Login page is now slightly more user-friendly.
    * Document Emailing now has better performance
    * Document renaming is more intuitive
    * Discussions can now be searched via the advanced search
    * Folders whose title matches a simple search query (e.g. from the
      dashboard, or via the quick search box on the Browse pages) now
      appear in the search results.  Note:  this does not include the results
      of any Advanced search.
    * Adding users from difference sources is now easier to do.

New Features

    * Search queries saveable on per user-basis
    * The login page can now be customised through-the-web.
    * Admin can now disable the "preferences" dialog for all users.
    * Ensuring that your system is "transaction safe" can now be done 
      through the web interface.
    * Email recipients can now be filtered by the user's group.
