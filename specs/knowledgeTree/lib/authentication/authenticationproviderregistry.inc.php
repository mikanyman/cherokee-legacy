/**
 * This is where all authentication providers register themselves as
 * available to the system.  Only the classes are registered here, not
 * specific instances.
 *
 * For instance, an LDAP authentication provider is registered.  It
 * can't, by itself, perform any authentication, as it is not
 * configured.
 *
 * The authenticators table in the database lists specific instances
 * configured in the system.  It contains it's own name (for humans to
 * differentiate between instances), it's own namespace name (for the
 * system and plugins to be able to find it accurately), it's
 * authentication provider namespace name, and some configuration data
 * that is handed over to the authentication provider instance to
 * configure itself.
 *
 * If a user has no authenticator set up, the KnowledgeTree
 * Authentication Provider is used.  This is hard-coded to use the
 * KnowledgeTree users table to check the password against.
