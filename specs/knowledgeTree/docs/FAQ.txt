KnowledgeTree(tm) DMS - Frequently Asked Questions

Q: I can't seem to search inside my files?  

A: There are two things which may cause full-text search not to work: 

     1. Make sure that the Indexing plugin is enabled
        (in Admin > Misc > Manage Plugins)
     2. Ensure that the appropriate programs are installed, and
        (especially on Windows) that the config.ini section "indexer"
        contains the correct paths to the files.
