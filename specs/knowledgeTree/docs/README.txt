KnowledgeTree Document Management System
----------------------------------------

KnowledgeTree 3 is intended to be easier to use for users and
administrators (including a new user interface) and also easy for
developers to customise it and make plugins for it.

KnowledgeTree 3 includes a set of core and standard plugins that broadly
cover the functionality offered by KnowledgeTree 2, although almost all
code has been rewritten or analysed before reuse.

New and extended functionality includes:
    * Entirely new template-based user interface, allowing for easy changes to
      the application's look and feel and easy to implement co-branding
      opportunities.
    * On-demand indexing of files as opposed to scheduled indexing, ensuring
      files are searchable immediately after uploading and simplifying the
      installation of the server.
    * Secure versioning of document metadata, not just the document itself.
      This vastly increases the application's applicability in regulatory
      compliance scenarios.
    * A new tree document metadata type has been added with the tree being
      represented graphically on the user interface.
    * The User/Group schema has been extended to allow groups to be nested,
      thus providing for the mapping of users in more complex organisations.
    * The move folder and move file functionality is now transactional and
      records a history of changes to the folder structure.
    * Bulk import functionality allows administrators to import large numbers
      of files from external data sources quickly and easily.
    * KnowledgeTree administrators may customise and extend the KnowledgeTree
      online help facilities using a web-based editor.
    * A powerful plug-in architecture, providing KnowledgeTree developers with
      the ability to easily create new application functionality, hook into
      system events and expose the functionality on the user interface.
    * A revamped permissions system which is easier to use and provides finer
      grained control over a user's actions than in KnowledgeTree 2.x.  The
      extended functionality also lets KnowledgeTree community developers
      create their own permissions on the system, allowing their plug-ins to
      easily check permissions that they require to function.
