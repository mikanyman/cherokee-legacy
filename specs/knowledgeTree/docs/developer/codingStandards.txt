Coding Standard Doc
=====================
(Inform - can be formalized later. Only standards above and beyond those in the original spec are included here)

1) 	All functions return their required value on success or false otherwise.  On returning false, all function
	set the $_SESSION["errorMessage"] variable
2)	All presentation layer files must contain a list of the expected querystring and form variables they will receive
3)	Any function that inserts into a database table must begin its name with "create" e.g. createFolder().  The exception
	to this is a function which inserts into a link table.  It must begin its name with "add" e.g. addUserToGroup()
4)	All database tables that consist of id, name pairs will end in the word "lookup" e.g. groups_lookup
5)	All database tables that link two or more tables together will end in the word "link"
6)	When using the @return tag in the case of mixed return types, the return type should always be the
	type that is returned if the function succeedes i.e. does what it is supposed to do
